I am an ML engineer based in the bay area and I am passionate about using ML algorithms and data to help companies and individuals make better decisions. I have worked on various applications including dynamic pricing, personalized content recommendations as well as user targeting. 

Before I moved to California, I did my undergraduate studies in CS and Math at Rice University. I also spent the majority of my senior year doing research on applying randomized hashing algorithms to solving large scaled machine learning problems. 

More recently, I became very interested in human learning and how understanding it can inspire building intelligent machines. I'm currently exploring the intersection of cognitive science and ML while working as a research assistant at professor Tobias Gerstenberg's lab at Stanford University.
