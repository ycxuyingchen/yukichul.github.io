I am an ML engineer based in the bay area working on various applications including 
dynamic pricing, personalized content recommendations as well as user targeting. 

Before I moved to California, I did my undergraduate studies in CS and Math at Rice University. 
I also spent the majority of my senior year doing research on applying randomized hashing algorithms 
to solving large scaled machine learning problems. 

More recently, I became very interested in model-based reinforcement learning and causality in ML. 
I'm also generally curious about human learning and how it can inspire building intelligent machines.
