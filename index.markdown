I am an ML engineer based in the bay area working on various applied ML problems including dynamic pricing, personalized content recommendations as well as user targeting. 

Before I moved to California, I studied CS and Math at Rice University. I also did undergraduate research on applying randomized hashing algorithms to solving large scaled machine learning problems. 

More recently, I became very interested in model-based reinforcement learning and causal learning. I'm also generally curious about human learning and how it can inspire building intelligent machines.
