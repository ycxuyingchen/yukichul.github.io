I am a first year CS PhD student at University College London (UCL) supervised by [Edward Grefenstette](https://www.egrefen.com/) and [Tim Rockst√§schel](https://rockt.github.io/). I am also a PhD Researcher at [Meta AI Labs](https://ai.facebook.com/). My research goal is to build machines that can learn to accomplish tasks efficiently in unknown, complex, sparse-reward environments. I'm also generally curious about human learning and how it can inspire building intelligent machines. 

Before starting my PhD, I was an ML engineer based in the bay area working on various applications including 
dynamic pricing and content recommendations. I did my undergraduate studies in CS and Math at Rice University, where I also did research on applying randomized hashing algorithms to solving large scaled machine learning problems.
