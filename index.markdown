I am a first year CS PhD student at University College London (UCL) supervised by [Edward Grefenstette](https://www.egrefen.com/), [Tim Rockst√§schel](https://rockt.github.io/) and [Marc Deisenroth](https://deisenroth.cc/). I am also a Research Assistnt at [Facebook AI Research (FAIR)](https://ai.facebook.com/blog/fair-unveils-uk-phd-program-in-partnership-with-ucl/) Labs. My research interests mostly lie in model-based reinforcement learning and causality in ML. I'm also generally curious about human learning and how it can inspire building intelligent machines. 

Before starting my PhD, I was an ML engineer based in the bay area working on various applications including 
dynamic pricing and content recommendations. I did my undergraduate studies in CS and Math at Rice University, where I also did research on applying randomized hashing algorithms to solving large scaled machine learning problems.
