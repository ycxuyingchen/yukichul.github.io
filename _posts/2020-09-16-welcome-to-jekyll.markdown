I'm excited to FINALLY start my personal web! As a self-learner of ML, software development, cognitive science ... I have found myself benefited a lot from many of the blog posts out there. Espeically when I first got into a field, reading interesting blog posts is definitely easier than jumping directly into lengthy papers and textbooks. On the other hand, I believe that try writing blog posts summarizing newly learned knowledge would be a great way to deepen my understandings. 

So...

Here I am.
